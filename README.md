# Dotfiles

A minimal repo of dotfiles I want to record and version, and a shortlist of useful utilities.

## Script installation

Install brew packages:

```shell
brew bundle --file=Brewfile
```

Install global node packages:

```shell
xargs npm install < npm-list.txt
```

Add symlinks:

```shell
node index.js
```

## Manual installation

Some nice apps. Just the necessities.
