# Dotfiles

A minimal repo of dotfiles I want to record and version, and a shortlist of useful utilities.

## Script installation

Install brew packages:

```shell
xargs brew install < brew-list.txt
```

Install global node packages:

```shell
xargs npm install < npm-list.txt
```

Add symlinks:

```shell
# WARNING! This script is destructive and irreversible. Use at your own risk.
node index.js
```

## Manual installation

Some nice utilities. Just the necessities.
